## About the Collection

The website exhibits influential mathematicians from the last century, made by Eugeryl Paul Rondario for Math 10 under Sir Daryl Saddi.

Made using CB, https://collectionbuilder.github.io/. It is an open source tool framework for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
