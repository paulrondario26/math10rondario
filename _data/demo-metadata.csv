His most important work points out that the two major problems of statistical theory at that time, testing hypotheses and estimation, can both be regarded as simple special cases of a more general problem - known nowadays as a ""statistical decision problem"". He defines loss functions, risk functions, a priori distributions, Bayes decision rules, admissible decision rules, and minimax decision rules, and proves that a minimax decision rule has a constant risk under certain regularity conditions.","Hungarian; decision theory, statistics, economics",Romania,46.85052559,23.44403465,MacTutor,,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.,
